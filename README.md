# Chat app front end

This repo was created as practice following the [tutorial from Web dev simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBr-PybP_9c)

Minor modifications from the tutorial:

1. Easy-peasy store with local storage instead of context and local storage (Wanted to try out Easy peasy 5 and use some of the more advanced features).
2. MUI instead of Bootstrap (Wanted to try out MUI 5)
3. All messages have an identifier.
